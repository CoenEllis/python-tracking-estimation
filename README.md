# Python Tracking Estimation

This repository is a collection of Python experiments demonstrating state estimation and tracking systems using Kalman Filters.

## Overview
This repository has projects that demonstrate how prediction and measurement fusion works in 1D, 2D, and 3D, including adaptive filters and sensor fusion.

## Projects
### 1D
- **Kalman 1D** - Simple tracking and predictive model on 1D data.
- **Kalman 1D Interactive** - Simple tracking and predictive model on 1D data but with sliders to adjust Q and R.


Each project is inside its own folder and can be run independently. Projects shown above are organized into folders in the root.

## Purpose
This repository demonstrates how tracking systems work by using Kalman Filters.
